These are listed in the order they are applied to the signal.

- Mono
  Sums the two sides and then sends the sum to both channels.
- Volume
- Channel Phase Invert
  - Note that this is done before the channel swap
  - However, it is done AFTER mono - so you can get a really wide signal by
    turning on mono and then inverting one side.
- Channel Swap
